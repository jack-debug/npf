## Anti-Virus Warnings
Your computer may have a warning for the file. It may even say it's a virus. These are false positives as I don't have a license to sign my code with and the fact that the app is not widespread. If your antivirus presents a warning, it is a false positive. If all else fails, build the app in Visual Studio yourself.
