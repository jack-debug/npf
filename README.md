A sort of powerful network DOS tool for network stressing and testing.
## How to setup an attack
1. Enter the IP address
2. Enter a message you want to send (optional)
3. Enter the interval of packets sent (1 default) Setting the number lower will increase packets sent a second, higher will decrease packets sent a second. The lower the number the more bandwith you require for an attack.
4. Press start, a message will pop up when it starts.
5. Enjoy :)
